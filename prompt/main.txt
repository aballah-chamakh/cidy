I want to build a mobile app which allow the government teachers of Tunisia to track the attendance of their students into their 
private classes, which will allow them to : 
    - a clear idea on their 
        - revenue 
        - unpaid student 
        - the total unpaid amount 
    - save the contacts of their students which will allow them to contact next school season and ask them to enroll into 
      their private classes 
- in all of the screens of app must have a an app bar which contains 
    - in the most left a the tree line icons which toggle the sidebar 
    - in the middle the title of the screen 
    - in the most right a bell icon with a red circle in the top right of it which contains the number of notifications in the white color and this number
      is : the number of notifications that were added after the last time the user did open the notification screen , clicking on this bell routes us 
      to the notifications screen
- the app must have the following screens 
    - a login screen which contains : 
        - the email and the password fields
        - the forgot password link
        - the "you don't have an accounct ? register" link 
    - a register link which contains : 
        - full name,email,phone number,password, two checkboxes one for register as a student and the other for register as teacher and only one of 
          them can be selected ,after the user submit the form ask them to confirm his email address by 
          entering the verfication code which was sent to their email
        - the "you already have and account ? login" link 
    - once he logins or registers the app should have a sidebar that is based on the logged or registered profile :
        - for teachers : 
            - dashboard 
            - groups 
            - students 
            - settings
                - the price of each subject 
                - student payment alert : On or Off
            - week schedule 
            - enrollments requests 

    - For the teacher profile : 

        - the sidebar : 
            - dashboard 
            - week schedule 
            - groups 
            - students 
            - prices 
            - student requests 
            - parent requests 
            - notifications
            
        - the screens binded to each navigation item in the sidebar : 
            - the dashboard screen : 
                - the title of the App Bar is : "Dashboard"
                - the content of the screen :
