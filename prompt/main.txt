I want to build a mobile app with the name "Cidy" which allows the government teachers of Tunisia who run private classes to : 
    - track the attendance of their students into their classes
    - track the payments of their students
    - have notifications about the the due payment of students 
    - have a clear idea on their revenue and the due payments of their students
    - have a clear idea about their weekly schedule
    - send due payment notifications to the student and his parent
    - give the ability to the parents of the students to view the attendance and the payments of their sons so that the son
      can't fool his parents about their payments and attendance
    - give the ability for the students to view their attendance and payments
