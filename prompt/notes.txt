in the student detail screen : 
    -  we should add a group select input and the option list of this select must be the list of
       groups that the student belongs to
    -  the list of class sessions batch must be one of the selected group

- the student shouldn't have a level or a section since the group he is in wil refer to that
- the teacher can edit the name of the student only if the student didn't create his account in the app 


the new actions of the student  : 
    - remove the student from the group
    - add the student to a group

i did stop on this problems : 
    - should i allow the parent to send many parent request to handle the case of requesting the parenting for two student studying with the same teacher 
    - how to deal with the case of a son is no longer part of any teacher group 
    - the student got removed from group 
    - who is the teacher who owns  the profile of the student 

the student can send to the teacher student invite
the parent can send to the teacher student invite 
- when the teacher want to add a student into a group he can create a student
- when a student makes an enrollment request, the teacher can replace the created student by the requesting student 
- when a parent makes a parenting request the teacher can assign to him either a student created by the teache or a student created by student himself 

- if a parent sends a parenting request to two teachers for the same student and this student was created in both teachers account, here is how to handle 
  duplicate sons  : 
    - the parent should create his sons 
    - when the parent requests parenting, in the parenting request form he should specify the son 
- to do : 
    - add the ability to create a son in the sons screen

I want to build a mobile app which allow the government teachers of Tunisia to track the attendance of their students into their 
private classes, which will allow them to : 
    - a clear idea on their 
        - revenue 
        - unpaid student 
        - the total unpaid amount 
    - save the contacts of their students which will allow them to contact next school season and ask them to enroll into 
      their private classes 
- in all of the screens of app must have a an app bar which contains 
    - in the most left a the tree line icons which toggle the sidebar 
    - in the middle the title of the screen 
    - in the most right a bell icon with a red circle in the top right of it which contains the number of notifications in the white color and this number
      is : the number of notifications that were added after the last time the user did open the notification screen , clicking on this bell routes us 
      to the notifications screen
- the app must have the following screens 
    - a login screen which contains : 
        - the email and the password fields
        - the forgot password link
        - the "you don't have an accounct ? register" link 
    - a register link which contains : 
        - full name,email,phone number,password, two checkboxes one for register as a student and the other for register as teacher and only one of 
          them can be selected ,after the user submit the form ask them to confirm his email address by 
          entering the verfication code which was sent to their email
        - the "you already have and account ? login" link 
    - once he logins or registers the app should have a sidebar that is based on the logged or registered profile :
        - for teachers : 
            - dashboard 
            - groups 
            - students 
            - settings
                - the price of each subject 
                - student payment alert : On or Off
            - week schedule 
            - enrollments requests 


    to do : 

        - since i removed filters for the notifications update the dynamics of the notifications related to the filter (done)



        - for all of the inputs : 
            - check the if we added the right validations 
            - for the selects :
                - check if we added the right options with right dynamics 
            - the filter inputs that aren't in the popup filters : 
                - mention that changing their values updates the list in real time 
    
        - for each actions the user does (edit,create,delete,remove from) :
            - check if we have the right pre-requisites for it 
            - check how it will affects other things and handle that through either : 
                - specify what it affects
                - a warning message 
                - restricting the action
            - check if we missed a notification type 

        - for all of the lists  : 
            - check if did define how the empty list looks like
            - for the lists that contains many items : 
                - check if did include the pagination dynamics 



            new notifications types : 
                - for the student and the teacher : 
                    - the teacher changed the group of your subject, 
                        in which case : the user added a student to a group with a subject that the student is already in, in another group.
                    - the teacher deleted the group of your subject (don't make this notification part of the teacher remove you from a subject classes notificationtion)
                    - the teacher ended the relationship with the student (in the case of teacher deleted a student from his account)
                    - in one notification the accepted and the declined subjects for an accepted student request 
                    - in one notification the accepted and the declined subjects for an accepted parent request
                - for the parent and the teacher  : 
                    - the student changed his level or section which made him out of some of his group, because his new level and section doesn't match the the level and the section 
                      of his old groups


        - define in a json format  : 
            - the years of each level in tunisian education system from 6 years old to 18 years old
                - if the year has sections
